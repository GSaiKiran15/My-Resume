            <h2>Python - ★★★★☆</h2>
            <p>Python is my first programming language. I've done lot of LeetCode and HackerRank questions in python. I
                can
                also work on some data structures like LinkedList, Stacks and Queues in python.</p>

            <h2>HTML - ★★★★☆</h2>
            <p>As I started to have a budding interest on Web-Development I started learning HTML. HTML provides the
                structure to a website like a skeleton to a body.</p>

            <h2>JavaScript - ★★☆☆☆</h2>
            <p>I've started gaining interest in Web-Development when I was in my pre-final year of my
                Bachelor's. This
                interest lead me to this programming language. I'm familiar with DOM(Document Object Model),
                using API's
                and Asynchronous programming in JavaScript.</p>
